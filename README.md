# Zero-Knowledge-Proof Final Assignment: Sudoku

The main goal of this project is to provide a non-interactive short ZK argument that shows that the user has solved a Sudoku puzzle.

For this project, we have used the following paper as reference: https://www.tains.tohoku.ac.jp/netlab/mizuki/conf/zerosuno_fct2023_web.pdf

In the assignment, we created the following protocols and sub-protocols:
- Deck visualization (to make the proof more visual)
- Pile-Scramble Shuffle
- Uniqueness Verification Protocol
- Color Verification Sub-protocol
- 3 row-VerificationSub-protocol
- Color Change Sub-protocol and Block Verification
- 3 column-Verification Sub-protocol
